jPromise
======

jPromise is an implementation of the Promise/A+ spec. The letter 'j' is the first character of my family name.

It is an extremely lightweight implementation (about 120 LOC) and very useful for learning how to implement the Promise/A+ spec.

This implementation is made all by myself, no reference to other code.And I will update it constantly,and add some new features.
